- Add combined model of do-u-net with different layers.
- Add data augmentation with two datasets (optimized dataset with only 10 images with their masks and edge-masks 13 images, and the second dataset is ALL-IDB1 108 images)
- Prepare trained weights with different loss functions (binary crossentropy, Mean Squared Error MSE, Intersection Over Union IOU...)
